## ðŸ”„ CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Every push to `main` triggers the following actions:

1. **Builds the Docker image** for the frontend using the current commit SHA.
2. **Pushes the image** to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
3. **Updates the image tag** in the `cluster-state` repoâ€™s `values.dev.yaml` file.
4. **Commits the updated tag** and pushes the change back to the `cluster-state` repository to trigger downstream Kubernetes deployments.

> All of this is automated through reusable composite actions maintained in the [`github-actions`](https://github.com/QRify-platform/github-actions) repo.
